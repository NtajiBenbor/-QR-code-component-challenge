## My process

I started off by creating the basic structure of this project using HTML, then i gradually added style components to it using  custom CSS properties and the Guidelines provided in the style-guide.md document. I then created a repository for this project on github and finally diployed it to the web from the repository through Netlify.   


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I intially had problem attaching the fonts provided in the style-guide.md document to the both the HTML document as a link in the head section and also declearing the font using the @font-face rule in the Stylesheet. I was able to figure it  out after doing some Googling:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```
```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
    src: url(https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit);
}
```

### Continued development
 I want to get better at CSS Layouts like Grid, Flexbox and also Responsive web design in the future
